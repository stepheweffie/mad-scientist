### Contribution Process

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** to discuss new features or major changes
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-model`
- `fix/session-timeout-bug`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`
- `refactor/improve-logging`

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add comprehensive error handling for API calls

- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Add specific error messages for different failure types
- Update logging to capture error details
- Add tests for error scenarios

Fixes #123
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Test all major functionality:
   - Avatar generation
   - Chat interactions
   - Session management
   - Error handling

2. Test with different configurations:
   - Different log levels
   - Various AI models
   - Edge cases and error conditions

### Automated Testing

While we're working on comprehensive test coverage, please ensure:
- Your code doesn't break existing functionality
- New features include basic validation
- Error handling is properly implemented

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Comment complex logic or algorithms
- Update README.md if you change functionality

### Example Documentation

```python
async def generate_avatar(request: Request, model: str, prompt: str) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    Generate an AI avatar using the specified model and prompt.
    
    Args:
        request: FastAPI request object for session management
        model: Name of the AI model to use for generation
        prompt: Text prompt describing the desired avatar
        
    Returns:
        Data URL string containing the generated image
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the API call fails or model is not found
    \"\"\"
```

## üîç Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging

### Import Organization

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import logging
from typing import Any, Dict

# Third-party imports
import requests
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

# Local imports
from logging_config import get_logger
from mad_scientist import MadScientist
```

## üö® Security Guidelines

### Environment Variables

- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- Use the `.env` file for local development
- Document all required environment variables
- Use meaningful default values where possible

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use appropriate error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate

## ü§ñ AI Model Guidelines

### Adding New Models

When adding new AI models:

1. **Update the models list** in `mad_scientist.py`
2. **Test thoroughly** with various inputs
3. **Document capabilities** and limitations
4. **Consider guard rails** for responsible AI use
5. **Update the README** with model information

### Responsible AI Practices

- Implement appropriate content filtering
- Add warnings for potentially sensitive outputs
- Maintain transparency about model capabilities
- Consider bias and fairness implications
